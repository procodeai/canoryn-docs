# Architect Overview

The **Architect** is [[appName]]'s visual programming environment — an infinite canvas where you design agent behaviors by connecting nodes with wires.

Think of it as a visual script: instead of writing code line by line, you connect building blocks together to describe _what_ your agent should do and _when_.

## The Workspace

The Architect is split into three main panels:

| Panel                  | Location      | Purpose                                         |
| :--------------------- | :------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Browser**      | Left Sidebar  | Manage your agent files and folders.            |
| **Blueprint Canvas**   | Center        | The infinite canvas where you build your agent. |
| **Property Inspector** | Right Sidebar | Configure the selected node's settings.         |

> [!TIP]
> Press `Cmd + .` to toggle **Focus Mode**, which hides both sidebars for a distraction-free canvas.

## Core Building Blocks

### Nodes

Nodes are Visual blocks that represent a single action or decision. Every node has:

- **Input Ports** (left side): Receive execution flow or data.
- **Output Ports** (right side): Send execution flow or data.
- **Properties**: Configurable settings edited in the Inspector.

There are **5 categories** of nodes:

| Category    | Color     | Purpose                 | Examples                                   |
| :---------- | :-------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger** | 🟡 Yellow | Start execution         | On Start, Voice Command, Schedule, Webhook |
| **Logic**   | 🟣 Purple | AI and control flow     | Simple AI, OpenAI, If/Else, For Each       |
| **Action**  | Various   | Interact with the world | Speak, Play Music, Open URL                |
| **Memory**  | 🟢 Green  | Store and recall data   | Recall Memories, Set Variable              |
| **Utility** | 🔘 Gray   | Transform and inspect   | Prompt Builder, JSON Parser, Result Viewer |

### Wires

Wires are the connections between nodes. There are two fundamental types:

- **Flow Wires** (White): Control the _order_ of execution. "Do this, _then_ do that."
- **Data Wires** (Colored): Pass _values_ between nodes. "Use this text as the prompt."

### Groups

Groups are visual containers that help organize related nodes. Select nodes and press `Cmd + G` to group them.

## How Execution Works

1.  Every agent starts from a **Trigger** node (e.g., "On Start").
2.  Execution follows **Flow Wires** (white) from output to input.
3.  When a node executes, it reads its **Data Wires** for input values.
4.  The node processes and passes its results downstream.

                  latest news"
```
